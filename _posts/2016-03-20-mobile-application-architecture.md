Broadly, there are **two categories** of mobile apps available:

* **View-heavy data-driven**
    - Email, Social, News, Todo
* **Graphics-heavy drawing**
    - Games, Creative Art, Photo Editing 

In this post I'm gonna focus on **data-driven** apps.

## Screen Archtypes

- **Login**
- **Register**
- **Stream**
- **Detail**
- **Creation**
- **Profils**
- **Settings**
- **Maps**

## Application Architecture

- Learning to build real **data-driven** apps requires a few core concepts:

  - **Views:** Common Controls and View Layout

  - **Events:** Interaction and Event Handling

  - **Navigation:** Screen Flows and Navigation

  - **Data:** Models, Networking and Persistence

  - **Platform:** OS Services, Hardware, Accessing Sensors

- Real **data-driven** apps usually require an API.

  - Apps **display data** and this comes from a **source**.

  - Most mobile apps rely on **server-side APIs** for data.

  - When developing mobile, consider what sources your app's data is coming from / being saved to.  

  - Many apps **leverage existing APIs** while others require a custom server-side component.

## Controllers

Controllers work with views and models to **implement dynamic behaviors** including:

-  Network requests (API interaction)

-  Persistence (Storing data)

-  Event handling (Button clicks, Data Input)

-  Navigation (Moving between app views)

## Views 

- Views **display data** or **receive data** inputs.

## Models

Models on mobile usually reflect the server state for **data retrieved via APIs** including:

- Model definitions (properties, relationships)

- JSON/XML serialization/deserialization

- Persistence Storage (database)

- Data Formatters

## Networking

Networking on mobile means **interacting with a server in** one of the following ways:

- Interacting with models via a REST API

- Displaying external images in the view

- Audio/video playback

- Socket programming (rare)

##  Hardware

Leveraging **device features** including:

- Camera

- GPS

- Accelerometer

- Bluetooth, AirDrop

- Contacts, Calendar, SMS, Mail

## Architecture Review

In summary, we have reviewed:

- Mobile is growing fast and demand is high

- We are focusing on data-driven app development

- **Data-driven** apps require a server-side API

- All mobile development has a consistent architecture

- Mobile largely is **MVC + Networking + Hardware**
