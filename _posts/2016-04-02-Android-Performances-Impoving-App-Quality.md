Apps nowadays are all about fancy **animations**, complex **transitions** and **custom views** And the experience must be the most robust and similar as possible in any device . those patterns help you build an app that's smooth, responsive, and uses as little battery as possible


## Patterns to avoid bad performance

- Avoid blocking **main Thread**

- Avoid **unnecessary** invalidations that may **trigger** a cascade of invalidations

- Use **RelativeLayouts** in a high hierarchy level

- Avoid Nested **weights** in LinearLayouts ( Cz each child needs to be measured twice)

- Avoid Customs **views** not **properly** made

- Avoid Creating **Unnecessary** Objects

- Use **Static Final** For Constants (static 15%-20% faster)

- Primitives (Integer vs Float 2x slower)

- Avoid Internal **Getters/Setters** (direct field access 3x faster)

- Use Enhanced For **Loop** Syntax

- Consider **Package** Instead of Private Access with Private Inner Classes

- Use **Native** Methods Carefully

## Patterns for custom views
  
Keep It as Simple as Possible (KISS)

- Use **<merge>** tag as root in your layout (avoid extra ViewGroups on inflation)

- **<include>** tag (easy code reuse of common layouts)

- Avoid **unnecessary** layouts

- Don’t make allocations or heavy operations in **OnDraw**

- Remove unnecessary calls to **invalidate()**

- Consider creating your own ViewGroup 

- RecyclerView (replaces ListView and GridView)

## Patterns to avoid memory churn

- Don’t allocate a large amount of **unnecessary** objects:
	
	- Immutable classes: String
	
	- Autoboxing: Integer, Boolean…
	
	- Don’t allocate in onDraw

- Consider using **Object Pools** and caches to reduce churn

## Patterns to avoid memory leaks 

- Don't leak **contexts** in inner classes

- Don't leak **views** inside activity

- Favor **static** inner classes over **non static**

- Don't use **WeakHashmap** as cache. Only the keys are **WeakReference**
 
## Patterns for CPU

- Do not nest multi-pass layouts

- Lazily compute complex data when needed

- Cache heavy computational results for re-use

- Consider RenderScript for performance

- Keep work off of the main thread

##  Patterns to avoid Overdraw

- Simplify your drawables

- Use nine patch with transparent parts

- Caution with setting alpha in your views

## Patterns to handling Bitmaps

Handle bitmaps in a poper way:

- Decode **bitmaps** to the desire size: **BitmapFactory.Options** (inSampleSize, inDensity, inTargetDensity)
  
- Load bitmaps in **memory** at the dimensions is going to be displayed

- Don’t **scale** if you don’t need to (**createScaledBitmap(btimap, int, int)**)

- Use **LRU** cache

## Patterns for Memory

- Do not allocate inside the draw path

- Be mindful of the overhead of enums

- Use specialized collections instead of JDK collections when appropriate (SparseArray)

## Patterns for I/O

- Batch operations with reasonable **back-off** policies

- Use **gzip** or **binary** serialization format

- Cache **data** offline with **TTLs** for reloading

- Use **JobScheduler API** to batch across OS

## Patterns for Services

- Do not keep running **service** unless it's actively **performing** a job. Also be careful to **stop** service it when its work is done

- System prefers to always keep the service process in running. Then the RAM used by the service can’t be used by anything else or paged out

- The best way to limit the lifespan of your service is to use an IntentService, which finishes itself as soon as it's done handling the intent that started it

- Leaving a service running when it’s not needed is one of the worst memory management mistakes an Android app can make

## Patterns for Threads

- In a Thread **run()** method use **Process.setThreadPriority()** with **THREAD_PRIORITY_BACKGROUND**. This approach reduces resource competition between the Runnable object's thread and the **UI thread**.

- If you don't set the thread to a **lower priority** this way, then the thread could still slow down your app because it operates at the **same priority** as the **UI thread** by default.

- **Stores** the current **Thread** reference in your app, so that you want to interrupt the Thread later on. e.g On network failure you can cancel that thread operation.

## Patterns to avoid ARNs

- On **UI thread** do as little work as possible

- If your application is doing work in the background in response to user input, show that progress is being made (such as with a ProgressBar in your UI).

- Use performance tools such as **Systrace** and **Traceview** to determine bottlenecks in your app's responsiveness.

- If your application has a **time-consuming** initial setup phase, consider showing a **launch screen** or **rendering** the main view as quickly as possible, indicate that loading is in progress and fill the information asynchronously.
